# Group Retrospective

As a group, we are satisfied with our work on all of the mini-stack assignments and this SDK. We not only successfully applied each database to the steam reviews dataset, but also learned a lot about the features and benefits of each in the process.

## Work Distribution

Below decribes who was primarily responsible for each part of each assignment. Note that this is not a complete list of all the work each person did, but rather a list of the major parts of each assignment that each group member was responsible for. All group members contributed to every part of each assignment in some capacity.

Dataset used: 'McDonalds Ice Cream Machines Breaking - Timeseries'

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machines-broken-timeseries

My chosen dataset documents the status of various McDonald's locations, specifically whether thier ice cream machine is working. The machines seem to be broken at an unusual rate, and is a general inconvenience to the customer. They can use this data to see what locations they can best go to when in need of soft serve or a McFlurry.

- Addendum

Apparently this is such an issue that the government is actually looking into it.

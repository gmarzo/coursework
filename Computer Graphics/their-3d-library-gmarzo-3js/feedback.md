| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| | **_pitch.md_** | |
| • Use case description | The scene’s use case is described sufficiently. Honestly, I love the idea. It sounds so adorable. | 2/2 |
| • Animation description | The pitch describes the autonomous animation properly via the steam rising from the tea cup | 2/2 |
| • Interaction description | The pitch describes the interaction functionality properly via using buttons to drink from and fill the tea cup. | 2/2 |
| • Addition/removal behavior | Pitch describes the addition and removal objects via adding and removing tea drops from the scene | 2/2 |
| • Collision detection behavior | The pitch describes collision detection behavior sufficiently | 2/2 |
| | **Autonomous animation** | |
| • Aligns with use case | The animation fits the autonomous use case | 2/2 |
| • Differs from startup code | Autonomous animation differs from the starter code. |  |
| • Implementation | Autonomous animation is implemented well via the steam object using TweenJS | 5/5 |
| | **User interaction** | |
| • Aligns with use case | Interaction works perfectly. The buttons do exactly as expected! | 2/2 |
| • Differs from startup code | Interaction differs from the startup |  |
| • Implementation | Interaction is implemented very well. Great job implementing the movements as a function of each character. Very object oriented! | 5/5 |
| | **Lighting** | |
| • Aligns with/well-chosen for use case | Ambient light and a single directional light seems a bit scarce for your scene. Lights were also only white. We would have liked to see a bit more variation (–1) | 2/3 |
| • Materials that use lights | Scene objects have materials that respond to light | 3/3 |
| | **Textures** | |
| • Three or more texture-mapped objects | Scene has at least three textured objects | 6/6 |
| • Texture creator/source acknowledgments | All of the textures were credited |  |
| | **On-the-fly object addition to scene** | |
| • Aligns with use case | Object addition aligns with the use case | 2/2 |
| • Implementation | Object addition is done very well. The tea drop is added to the scene when pouring. Great job! | 3/3 |
| | **On-the-fly object removal from scene** | |
| • Aligns with use case | Object removal aligns with the use case | 2/2 |
| • Implementation | Object removal is also done very well. The tea drop is removed once it collides with the liquid in the tea cup. Very nicely done! | 3/3 |
| | **Collision detection** | |
| • Aligns with use case | Collision detection behavior aligns with the use case | 2/2 |
| • Uses actual object position and state | Collision detection logic uses actual object positions. | 7/7 |
| • Implementation | You determine collision based on the y position of an object | 5/5 |
| Code maintainability | Repository compiled with errors. You returned the residual stop function, but deleted it already in _demo-universe.js_ (–1) | -1 |
| Code readability | You have a lot of commented out code in your repository, which can make it hard to read. Remember to clean up your repository before submitting next time (–2) | -2 |
| Version control | Decent commit count and relatively descriptive commit messages for the group size. |  |
| Punctuality | First commit on 1/30 1:56 pm; last commit on 2/8 10:57 am.  |  |
| | **Total** | **56/60** |

## Scene pitch

This scene involves a tea set atop a japanese-style blanketed table, which can be used as either the basis for or background element of a 3D animation or game (ideally after being touched up).

### Auto-movement

- There is a repeated animation of a steam ring coming from the cup.

### Interactivity

- Some of the button from the original react app are used to fill and drink the tea from the cup.

### Collision detection & On-the-fly removal

- The teadrops that come from the kettle interact with the liquid in the cup, where each one makes the tea level rise by a small amount. The teadrop itself is also added and removed dynamically from the scene.

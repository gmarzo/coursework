| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Stub web app | Stub web app provides testbed for scene library | 5/5 |
| | **Screen construct/framework** | |
| • Setup | Scene code is structured to handle WebGL setup and connection to `canvas` in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| • Add/remove | `Scene` handles addition and removal | 4/4 |
| • Rendering | Scene code renders to a canvas in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| • Implementation | No implementation issues found | 3/3 |
| | **3D object framework** | |
| • Different shapes | Framework accommodates different shapes | 2/2 |
| • Color | 3D object framework stores at least a single color | 2/2 |
| • Groups/composites | 3D object framework includes a proper group/composite construct | 8/8 |
| • Implementation | 3D object framework implementation is generally clear and straightforward | 3/3 |
| | **Polygon mesh data structure** | |
| • Vertices/triangles | Mesh data structure stores vertices and faces (triangles) appropriately.  | 10/10 |
| • Extensibility | Mesh data structure design allows for easy extension to accommodate future values | 5/5 |
| • Solid vs. wireframe | Mesh data structure produces wireframe and solid renders in a relatively straightforward manner. | 5/5 |
| • Implementation | Mesh implementation is done relatively well. You conflated the Object3D implementation with the Mesh implementation in the `Shape` class, but that's fine. | 5/5 |
| | **Mesh maker library** | |
| • Sphere | Sphere is implemented correctly | 20/20 |
| • _shape-credits.md_ | _shape-credits.md_ clearly lists who did what |  |
| • Implementation | Shape framework is overall implemented consistently and sufficiently well | 10/10 |
| Extra credit (if any) | 1 mesh test (+1) | 1 |
| Code maintainability | No major issues. Everything seems to be laid out directly in the `src` folder, which is fine for now. It may be in your best interest to add additional structure via folders.<br><br>Repository compiled with several warnings (–1) | -1 |
| Code readability | Code is readable. No major readability issues. |  |
| Version control | Decent commit count with sufficiently descriptive messages |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit of tag: 03/28/23 8:53 PM<br /><br /> **Graded commit:** https://github.com/lmu-cmsi3710-spring2023/our-own-3d-library-hexed-vortex-graphic/commit/60663c193214be8b92be7809f8ffa73837f4145f |  |
